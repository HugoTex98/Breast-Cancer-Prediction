# Breast Cancer Prediction Project

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a Python-based program that processes, visualizes, and classifies data from a dataset containing indicators of breast cancer patients. The project involves exploring various Machine Learning models to predict (diagnose) whether a patient is likely to have breast cancer.

## Objectives

- **Data Extraction and Visualization**: Extract and visualize key characteristics from a dataset of breast cancer indicators.
- **Model Development**: Develop and compare multiple classification models (SVM, Random Forest, ANN/DNN) to predict whether a patient is likely to have breast cancer.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Utilize appropriate metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall) to evaluate the performance of the models and determine the best-performing classifier.

3. **`CLEAR`**: Clear the loaded data from memory.
4. **`QUIT`**: Exit the program.
5. **`DESCRIBE`**: Provide a statistical summary of the numerical data and count benign and malignant cases.
6. **`SORT`**: Sort the data by patient ID, handle missing values, and encode the classification labels.
7. **`CORRELATION`**: Remove irrelevant features and visualize correlations using a heatmap.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HugoTex98/Breast-Cancer-Prediction.git
    cd Breast-Cancer-Prediction
    ```
2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. **Install the required dependencies:**

The code is written in Python and requires the following libraries:

## Building and Running the Docker Container

To build and run the Docker container for this project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Build the Docker Image

First, navigate to the root directory of the project (where `Dockerfile` is located) and run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t breast-cancer-prediction .
```

This command builds the Docker image using the instructions in the Dockerfile and tags it as breast-cancer-prediction.

### 2. Run the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run the Docker container using the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm breast-cancer-prediction
```

 - **`-it`**: Runs the container in interactive mode, allowing you to interact with the terminal inside the container.
 - **`--rm`**: Automatically removes the container once it stops running, keeping your environment clean.
 - **`breast-cancer-prediction`**: The name of the Docker image you built.

Since the project is not a web application and does not expose any ports, the output from the script will be directly visible in the terminal where the container runs. If the script generates output files, they will be saved in the container's file system.

To stop the container while itâ€™s running, you can do so by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal where the container is running.

## Usage

Run the program using the command-line interface:

```bash
python main.py
```
Follow the prompts to load data, process it, and visualize various aspects related to heart disease indicators.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to implement the following improvements and features to enhance the functionality and performance of this project:

1. **New branch**: 
   - Creation of a new branch for new developments.
  
2. **Store models parameters**
   - Store models parameters in the results.

3. **Expanded Model Selection**: 
   - Integrate additional machine learning models, such as Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) or XGBoost, to compare performance with the current models.

4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**:
   - Implement Optuna to optimize the performance of the classifiers.

5. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Apply data augmentation techniques (SMOTE) to increase the dataset and potentially improve model accuracy.

6. **User Interface**:
   - Develop a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to make the program more user-friendly, allowing users to load data, select models, and view results without needing to interact directly with the command line.

7. **Containerization and Deployment**:
   - Refine the Docker setup to allow for easy deployment on cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, including CI/CD pipeline integration.

8. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Implement unit tests and continuous integration (CI) pipelines to ensure code quality and detect potential issues before deployment (maybe ML Flow for model monitoring).

9. **Enhanced Visualization**:
    - Add more advanced visualization options, including 3D plots or interactive dashboards, to provide deeper insights into the data and model outputs.
